This repo provides several examples on how to handle data of different types for inference with Triton Inference Server. The examples are written in Python and use the Triton Python client library.

### Audio Data
This example demonstrates how to handle audio data for inference with Triton Inference Server. The example uses a simple librosa script in place of a model to extract the Beats Per Minute (BPM) from an audio file. The audio file is passed to the Triton Inference Server as a raw byte array.

The scripts are located in the models_repo/bpm_librosa directory.
